I'm a University of Alberta Electrical Engineering grad, amateur musician, and dabbling photographer. I created this blog in 2022 to document my personal projects for job applications and anybody else who might be interested.

Check out Jekyll Now [here](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) (the package I used to make the blog).
